# indiehackers2epub

One summer I was on holidays with my family and I found Indiehackers.com website having a bunch of great enterpreneur stories.
I wanted to read all of them using my Kindle, so I wrote this tiny script to download and convert automatically each IndieHackers.com interviews to Epub for offline reading using EpubPress service library.

## Demo

![npm start](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sortegam/indiehackers2epub/master/docs/demo.gif)

## How to run

Open your terminal and run

  - `npm i`
  - `npm start`


It will download IndieHackers interviews in epub format to the local ebooks folder.

Enjoy.
